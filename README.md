# Global_Cybersecurity
This repository contains the code and resources for The Global Cybersecurity Threats dataset (2015-2024).
This project analyzes global cybersecurity threats using real-world incident data to identify patterns, high-risk sectors, vulnerabilities, and defense effectiveness. Key insights were extracted through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization. A forecasting model was also implemented to predict attack trends by defense mechanism type between 2025 and 2028. The project provides actionable insights to strengthen cybersecurity strategies across industries, improve defense mechanism selection, and guide future investments in cyber defense infrastructure.

Tools Used:
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Tableau for interactive dashboards
